    <LI>ContainerListView 
    <UL>
      <LI>Create wrapper around scroll bars to set focus to 
      parent and allow for easier (vScrollBar.Visible ? vScrollBar.Height : 0) 
      <LI>         
               Complex headers ("Justified form mode" in MS Access, or basically multiple rows of headers which will 
      define the rows as well) 
      <LI>Faster sorting by making "text" an object and allowing custom data to be put in instead of&nbsp;converting to 
      text, or allowing SortData field 
      <LI>Better design time support 
      <LI>More intelligent rendering (I'm wasting a few 
      cycles drawing stuff that doesn't need to be drawn) 
      <LI>Drag and drop functionality 
      <LI>Row re-ordering via drag-drop 
      <LI>Copy and paste functionality 
      <LI>More customizable styles (ala dataGrid styles 
      without the headaches) 
      <LI>Window splits 
      <LI>     Code comments 
      (this always seems to end up in ALL open 
      source projects TODO lists) 
      <LI>Checkboxes / radio buttons
      <LI>Double-click to "edit" mode where ItemControl is shown only then and a 
      custom defined property is shown as text
      <LI>Built in filter bar with two modes, one box with a specified column, 
      or&nbsp;a box per column with the ability to turn on and off
      <LI>Mouse drag box to highlight
      <LI>Turn extra header space into a possible Chevron for built in column 
      hiding/showing
      <LI>Turn extra space near scroll bars into data 
      explorer type thing (like the XSD designer in VS.NET) 
      <LI>Column sizing support: 
      <UL>       
        <LI>Individual columns can be made non-sizable
        <LI>Columns can be made to maintain their 
        percentage, which can be set or calculated</LI></UL>
      <LI>Test to see if setting any of the colors to 
      Color.Empty will break anything 
      <LI>Add a Tag property to the subitem, add a new sort 
      data type to specify sorting by the Tag ... it will assume the Tag is of 
      type IComparable... 
      <LI>               
            Add unit testing to help with bug 
      reports            
          
      <LI>Basically anything that will make this a 
      comparable/better tool to the current ListView implementation or any 
      available open or commercial products out there
      <LI>Add ability to specify how the sub-control should resize with the sub 
      item.&nbsp; Probably WidthAndHeight, HeightOnly, WidthOnly, Height, 
      Width.</LI></UL>
    <LI>Bugs 
    <UL>
      <LI>Column reording with tree column (have the glyphs always draw on the 
      first actual column, not first display column, somehow this needs to work 
      with full row selection too)
      <LI>Multi-select in tree mode (possibly create different "selection 
      modes", one for list (which is working), and one for tree that I can fix 
      without breaking list)
      <LI>Adding child items doesn't render properly 
      (dynamically)
      <LI>Top border line isn't being drawn when grid lines is on and the item 
      isn't the first item.
      <LI>Child controls should likely be clipped to the item rect, as if they 
      are too tall, they'll go over into rows above and below
      <LI>EnsureVisible doesn't expand nodes to make the item visible
      <LI>Child controls don't become invisible when the parent item is 
collapsed
      <LI>Performance and memory usage seems to have gone down the tubes
      <LI>Moving mouse uses up a lot of memory?
      <LI>When sort data type is custom and no custom comparer has been set, 
      errors</LI></UL> </LI></UL> </LI></UL>
