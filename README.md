Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/nprof before code.google.com closes down and we loose it all.

I decided to put it in a same organisation as slimtune as it could be considered a precursor to slimtune.

"NProf is not actively developed anymore. If you are looking for an open source .NET profiler, take a look at SlimTune"
